# GSQL Syntax highlighting #
GSQL is what Tigergraph uses as it's graph query language.

I've based this off [sql.vim](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3702).

# Install
Use your favorite plugin manager.

I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```
Plug 'jmeekhof/gsql-vim'
```
